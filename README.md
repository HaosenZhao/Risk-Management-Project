A theoretical model of optimal capital structure based on the Merton model was built in Excel. 
The Merton (1974) model of a corporation requires that the asset value or firm value A=100 is traded and is correlated to an asset that is traded, the S&P 500. Assume the S&P 500 follows GBM with drift 10% and standard deviation 15%, and has correlation of r=0.75 with A. The capital structure of a firm is composed entirely of equity and debt, where debt is in the form of a single discount bond with face value F at maturity T=1. Assets are liquidated at time T and distributed to debt and equity. The risk-free continuously compounded discount rate is r=2%.

• In the event of insufficient assets at time T to pay debtholders, a fraction l=20% of the liquidation value of the company is lost to financial distress costs. If debtholders are paid in full, there are no distress losses.
• The corporate tax rate is t=35% of the appreciation in asset value, but debt interest is tax deductible. Debt interest is defined to be max(DT-D0,0), so there is no tax credit if debt is not fully paid.
• After distress costs, debtholders, and taxes, equityholders keep residual cash flows.
Parameters A, F, a, s are changable.
